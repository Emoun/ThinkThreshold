# ThinkThreshold
A windows 10 script to set the Lenovo battery threshold. Meant to be run often with Task Scheduler for laptops that "forget" the threshold settings. 

SEE README- SCRIPT WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT MANUAL CONFIGURATION (Different serial number for every battery, you must put yours into the script)

Documentation is a work in progress. See the readme.txt for now. Thanks!
